## Introduction

The market through supply and demand, is the main arbiter 
of how the available food is distributed within a country.
Food price volatility informs consumers and price analysts the availability 
of food in a given region. Surges in food prices reduce the purchasing power 
of households that are weakly linked to the markets and thus pose a 
challenge when endeavoring to adequately feed the poor. 
This leads the poor to limit their food consumption and shift to even 
less balanced diets with harmful effects on health.
This research finds that food price volatility is caused by a number of
factors such as the supply and demand, climatic changes, population explosion,
inflation rates, government subsidies and the current trends including pandemics,
calamities,war and natural disasters.
